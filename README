This is a port of BSD make (taken directly from FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE).

*.diff files contain all the changes I made.
I had to add err.c/err.h from FreeBSD libc and wrote simple Makefile
that should be suitable for gmake and Solaris make (you should uncomment two
lines for Solaris make in Makefile).

To install just copy Makefile.dist to Makefile, uncomment options for
your system and run make.

Tested successfully on Solaris 2.6, Slackware 7.0 and Redhat 6.0.
Makefile.pmake is Makefile for building pmake with pmake
(This is Makefile from FreeBSD which I used for pmake tests).
